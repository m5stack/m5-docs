## Description

**ATOMIC**  is a DIY Proto Kit designed specially for the Atom series, which makes it convenient for users to design small circuits or external hardware by themselves. It can be stacked with Atom directly via the 9 pins on the base. Two blank proto boards are provided in the kit, each of which provides more than 60 hole positions to meet the spatial layout requirements of users. A pair of 3.96 4 pin connectors are contained to make the external electrical connection more reliable. The shell incorporates a series of ventilation holes which allow heat dissipation and allows for more accurate temperature and humidity readings from sensors. The product provides a variety of attachment methods, such as mounting hole, Lego connection, screw mounting, etc. If you want to make a mini controller with customized characteristics, ATOMIC should be the best choice.
