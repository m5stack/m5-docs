## Description

**FACES II BOTTOM** is a FACES base with RGB light strips and GROVE compatible ports. The FACES II  is compatible with all function panels from the FACES Kit. The base is connected to the host via the M5BUS and communicates using the I2C protocol. The base has a built-in 600mAh rechargeable lithium-ion battery and comes equipped with a power management IC for easy use as a portable, handheld device. There are 5 RGB LEDs each on the left and right sides of the base, PORTB and PORTC interfaces on the top, and POGO PIN contacts on the bottom of the backside of the base through which it can be charged from the charging base. There are M3 screw holes and hanging holes on the top for mounting it easily to anything. The RGB LEDs are connected to GPIO15.

**<mark>Notice：PORT description </mark>**
*Ports of different colors have different functions. Black-PortB (26/36), supports DA/AD conversion and signal bus communication. Blue-PortC (16/17), supports UART serial communication. Based on the required function, the corresponding unit can be connected to the FACES II base by just attaching it to the port with the matching color.
